# Time to retire

Immich has moved from Tensorflow to PyTorch from Immich version 1.49.0.
This repo is not needed anymore and has been archived.

The container images have been deleted.

# Immich machine learning for x86 without AVX

## Usage

Find your immich docker-compose file and replace

`image: altran1502/immich-machine-learning:release`

by

`image: bertmelis1/immich-machine-learning-noavx:release`

## What is this?

Immich is a high performance self-hosted photo and video backup solution.
For image classification, Immich relies on Tensorflow. Tensorflow is by standard built for 'newer' processors that support AVX. People that run Immich on older systems have the option to just not run the immage classification container, build Tensorflow themselves (using the files in this repo?) or use this alternative.

## Last words

- As is Immich, this repo is published under the MIT license.
- The generated image is by far not optimized and is probably much larger than the original immich-machine-learning image. Feel free to create PRs to improve.
- I follow the Immich release schedule but do this manually. Some delay is to be expected, especially when new Tensorflow binaries are needed.
- Tensorflow is built using the latest release and is build for a "generic x86-64" cpu. This means there is no optimization for AVX nor for SSE or other instruction sets.
